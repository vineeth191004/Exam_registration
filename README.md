# Exam Registration Web Page

This repository contains the source code for a simple and responsive exam registration webpage. The project demonstrates front-end development skills using HTML and CSS to replicate a design mockup without any external CSS libraries or frameworks.

## Project Overview

The web page allows users to register for exams by filling in their details in a registration form. Once the form is filled and submitted, users will see a success page confirming their registration.

### Features:
- **Responsive Design**: The page is responsive across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Simple and Clear Layout**: Clean form layout with semantic HTML and well-commented CSS for maintainability.
- **Registration Form**: Users can input their full name, email, phone number, select an exam, and choose a date for the exam.
- **Success Page**: After submitting the form, the user is redirected to a success page confirming their registration.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main file that contains the registration form.
- **success.html**: The page shown after a successful registration.
- **exams.css**: The main CSS file responsible for styling the registration form and success page.
- **exam.png**: Banner logo used in the header section.
- **exam_registration_final.pdf**: Merged PDF file containing the HTML, CSS, and a screenshot of the project.
